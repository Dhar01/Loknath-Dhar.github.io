This post is just a summary of those content.\nAlso, if anyone wants to practice SQL, see Hackerrank\u0026rsquo;s SQL problem-set.\n This is still in the early stage. Any suggestions will be appreciated.\n  A relational database system contains one or more objects called tables. Tables are identified by their names and are comprised of columns and rows.\nSELECT The SELECT statement is used to query the database and retrieve selected data that match the criteria we specify.\n All statements end with an ;.\n SELECT column FROM table_name;  Use * to select all columns.\n WHERE The WHERE clause specifies which data or rows will be returned or displayed based on the criteria described after the keyword WHERE.\nConditional selections used in the WHERE clause:\n   Sign Meaning     = Equal   \u0026gt; Greater than   \u0026lt; Less than   \u0026gt;= Greater than or equal   \u0026lt;= Less than or equal   \u0026lt; \u0026gt; Not equal to   LIKE see details below    The LIKE pattern matching operator can also be used in the conditional selection of the where clause.\nIt is a very powerful operator that allows selecting only rows that are like what is specified. The percent sign (%) can be used as a wild card to match any possible character that might appear before or after the characters specified.\nSELECT first, last, city FROM employee_info WHERE first LIKE \u0026#39;Er%\u0026#39;; CREATE TABLE The CREATE TABLE statement is used to create a new table.\nCREATE TABLE table_name ( column1 data_type, column2 data_type, column3 data_type ); Example:\nCREATE TABLE employees ( name varchar(30), position varchar(30), age number(3), salary(8,2) ); Common data types:\n   type description     char (size) Fixed-length character string, size is specified in parenthesis. Max 255 bytes.   varchar (size) Variable-length character string. Max size is specified in parenthesis.   number (size) Number value with a max number of column digits specified in parenthesis.   date Date value   number (size, d) Number value with a maximum number of digits of size total, with a maximum number of d digits to the right of the decimal.    A constraint is a rule associated with a column that the data entered into that column must follow the rules.\nINSERT INTO a table The INSERT INTO statement is used to insert or add a row of data into the table.\nINSERT INTO table_name (first_column, .... last_column) VALUES (first_value, .... last_value);  All strings should be enclosed between single quotes 'string'.\n Example:\nINSERT INTO employees (name, position, age, salary) VALUES (\u0026#39;Dirk Smith\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Programmer\u0026#39;, 32, 45300.00), (\u0026#39;Lokanth Dhar\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Admin\u0026#39;, 26, 35000.00), (\u0026#39;Muidul Islam\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Doctor\u0026#39;, 26, 40000.00); UPDATE records The UPDATE statement is used to update or change records that match specified criteria.\nUPDATE table_name SET column_name = new_value, next_column = new_value2 WHERE column_name OPERATOR value and|or column OPERATOR value; Example:\nUPDATE phone_book SET area_code = 623 WHERE prefix = 979; UPDATE phone_book SET last_name = \u0026#39;Smith\u0026#39;, prefix = 555, suffix = 9292 WHERE last_name = \u0026#39;Jones\u0026#39;; DELETE records The DELETE statement is used to delete records or rows from the table.\nDELETE FROM table_name WHERE column_name OPERATOR value; example:\nDELETE FROM employee; -- all records will be deleted  DELETE FROM employee WHERE first_name = \u0026#39;Mike\u0026#39; or first_name = \u0026#39;Eric\u0026#39;;  To insert comment, use --\n DROP a table The DROP TABLE command is used to delete a table and all rows in the table.\nTo delete an entire table including all of its rows:\nDROP TABLE table_name ","permalink":"https://dhar01.github.io/posts/sql-overview-basic/","summary":"This is a note type post for personal reference.

When browser knows the server\u0026rsquo;s IP address, it ask the server for the web page which is done with a HTTP GET request.\nGET is an example of a HTTP verb, which are the different types of request. The server responds to the GET request with the web page content. IF the web page is loading extra resources, like JavaScript, images, or CSS files, those will be retrieved in separate GET requests.\nFor most websites now, these request will use HTTPS, a secure (encrypted) version of HTTP. This uses TLS 1.3 (normally) encryption in order to communicate without:\n other parties being able to read the data. other parties being able to modify the data.  A web server is a software that receives and responds to HTTP(S) requests. Example: Apache, Nginx, Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s IIS.\nHTTP runs on port 80 and HTTPS runs on port 443.\n What request verb is used to retrieve page content?  Ans: GET.\n What port do web servers normally listen on?  Ans: 80.\n What\u0026rsquo;s responsible for making websites look fancy?  Ans: CSS.\nTask 3 Requests There are 9 different HTTP \u0026ldquo;verbs\u0026rdquo;, also known as methods. Each one has a different function.\nPOST requests are used to send data to a web server.\nA HTTP request can be broken down into parts.\nGET /index.html The next section is headers, which give the server more information about requests.\nFinally, body of the requests. For POST requests, this is the content that\u0026rsquo;s sent to the server.\nResponses The server reply with a response, a status. Normally it\u0026rsquo;ll be a code. A basic breakdown of the status code is:\n 100-199 : information. 200-299 : Successes. (200 OK is the \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; response for a GET) 300-399 : Redirects (the information you want is elsewhere) 400-499 : Client errors (client did something wrong, like asking for something that doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist) 500-599 : server errors (server tried, but something went wrong on their side)   What verb would be used for a login?  Ans: POST.\n What verb would be used to see your bank balance once you\u0026rsquo;re logged in?  Ans: GET.\n Does the body of a GET request matter? Yea/Nay  Ans: Nay.\n What\u0026rsquo;s the status code for \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m a teapot\u0026rdquo;?  Ans: 418.\n What status code will you get if you need to authenticate to access some content, and you\u0026rsquo;re unauthenticated?  Ans: 401.\nTask 4 Cookies are small bits of data that are stored in browser.\nEach browser store them differently, so cookies won\u0026rsquo;t be able to another browser. They have a huge number of uses, but most common are either session management or advertising (tracking cookies). Cookies are normally sent with every HTTP request made to server.\nAs HTTP is stateless (each request is independent and no state is tracked internally), cookies are used to keep track of this. They allow sites to keep track of data.\nCookies have:\n a name : identifies the cookie. a value : where data is stored. an expiry date : when the browser will get rid of the cookie automatically. a path : what requests the cookie will be sent with.  The server is normally what sets cookies, and those come in the response headers (Set-Cookie). These can be set from javascript inside browser.\nWhen log in to a web application, normally they given a Session token. This allows the web server to identify requests. Stealing someone else\u0026rsquo;s session token can often allow to impersonate them.\nTask 5 We can make HTTP reques in many ways, including without browsers. For CTFs, we\u0026rsquo;ll ned to use cURL or a programming language as this allows to automate repetitive tasks.\nBy default, curl will perform GET requests on whatever URL it get suppplied, such as curl https://tryhackme.com\nThis will retrieve the main page of that website. With command line flags, we can do:\n The -X flag allows to specify the request type. Ex: -X POST. The \u0026ndash;data flag allows to specify the data to POST with, which default to plain text data.  Time for mini Ctf! There are some mentioned tasks on the ctf room. By connecting to the server with curl, we can get the flag for answers.\n What\u0026rsquo;s the GET flag?  Ans: thm{162520bec925bd7979e9ae65a725f99f}\n What\u0026rsquo;s the POST flag?  Ans: thm{3517c902e22def9c6e09b99a9040ba09}\n What\u0026rsquo;s the POST flag?  Ans: thm{91b1ac2606f36b935f465558213d7ebd}\n What\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026ldquo;Set a cookie\u0026rdquo; flag?
