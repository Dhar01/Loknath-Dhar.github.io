# üëã Hey there

I‚Äôm **Loknath**, a Linux enthusiast who bleeds Liverpool RED on matchday! Trying to be a programmer with Golang, also a stoner and an infrequent writer. I enjoy cinema, and anime, can‚Äôt live without songs, and buy more books than I read. I feel like dancing on the occasion of playing Fifa, sometimes craving for the smell and sounds of rain, and most of the time, for off days.

In the daytime, ~~I would love to see myself as a storyteller~~, but in reality, I pass my days as Jr. DevOps Engineer and wonder when I will build a good project by myself (*yeah, I am pretty bad at programming*). One special thing about me if you ask, I don't know much about operating a Windows system. Always had a Linux heart beating inside me!

Fear not! I may not be a *go-to-help-for-windows-system* type of guy, but hey, I'm open for some DevOps, InfoSec, Golang moments! Everything will be better if you're a Football fan, just drop me a line over [telegram](https://t.me/Dhar01), I'm about always available there!

And hey mate, nice to meet you! ü§ù

Currently,

- reading *Head First Go*, having a good time with this! Hope, I will be able to write some codes!
- very exited for the upcoming COSMIC by system76!
- re-watching *Game of Thrones*, one episode at a night.
