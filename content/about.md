# Hi

I’m **Loknath**, a Linux enthusiast who bleeds Liverpool RED on matchday! Trying to be a better programmer with Golang, a weed smoker and an infrequent writer. I enjoy cinema, and anime, can’t live without songs, and buy more books than I read. I feel like dancing on the occasion of playing Fifa, sometimes craving rain, and most of the time, off days.

In the daytime, I would like to see myself as a storyteller, but in reality, I pass my days as Jr. DevOps Engineer and wonder when I will build a good project by myself (*yeah, I am pretty bad at programming*).

Nice to meet you!
