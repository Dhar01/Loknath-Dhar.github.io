I often consider myself **"Lucky"** to be born in this era; the era of being connected, knowledge sharing and collaboration. While scrolling through the internet, I found so many well-written thoughts and blogs that should be shared. In my daily life, I'm trying to be a DevOps practitioner, to be a gopher and sharpen my knowledge of the basics.

Here, I will share some resources, i.e., blogs I find amazing. Whether you're a *DevOps practitioner, SRE, Linux System Administrator* or **belief in self-development** - these resources will significantly help you.

> 👉‍ Do note that they're all according to my preference! And notably, not affiliated! By nature, I'm a reader, so most probably, you're not gonna see any video lessons or something like that. Sorry!

Enjoy the readings!
