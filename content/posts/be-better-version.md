I often consider myself **"Lucky"** to be born in this era; the era of being connected, knowledge sharing and collaboration. While scrolling through the internet, I found so many well-written thoughts and blogs that should be shared. In my daily life, I'm trying to be a DevOps practitioner, to be a gopher and sharpen my knowledge of the basics.

Here, I will share some resources, i.e., blogs I find amazing. Whether you're a DevOps practitioner, SRE, Linux System Administrator or believe in self-development - these resources will significantly help you.

Enjoy the readings!
