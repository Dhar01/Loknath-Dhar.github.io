# Task 01


An autonomous system number (ASN) is a global identifier of a range of IP addresses. Basically, large companies like Google, Microsoft have their own ASN for all of the IP addresses they own.

To find out ASN, first, we can search their IP address: `ping google.com`

We can put the IP address into an **ASN lookup tool** such as [ultralools/asninfo](https://www.ultratools.com/tools/asnInfo)

Though, we can put the company name here to find the ASN, using the IP address seems the easiest one to me.

On shodan, we can search using the ASN filter. The filter is: `ASN:[number]`
here, the number is marked on the picture.
