# Study Resource

- [golangr](https://golangr.com/)
- [Golang Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/a8m/golang-cheat-sheet)
- [Codecademy - go](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/go)

# Books

- Head First Go (*got my introduction with this*)

> *Thoughts on Head-first Go*: This book was published before Generics was introduced in Go, so there's no introduction to Generics. The author discussed unbuffered channels but gave a short introduction to buffered channels.

# Exercises

- [exercism-go](https://exercism.org/tracks/go)
