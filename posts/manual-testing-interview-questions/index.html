Adding more questions.  About SDLC What is Software Development Life Cycle?\nAns: SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is the overall process of developing information system through a multi-step process from investigation of initial requirements through analysis, design, coding, testing, implementation and maintenance.\nWhat are the various models of SDLC?\nAns: There are many types of models. Among them:\n Waterfall model (Linear Sequential Model); Prototype Model; Rapid Application Development Model; Spiral Model; V-Model;  What is waterfall model?\nAns: The Waterfall model is a sequential process in which progress is seen as flowing downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of analysis, design, coding, testing, support and maintenance.\nWhat is spiral model?\nAns: In Spiral Model, activities are organized into many cycle. Each cycle begins with the\n identification of objectives for that cycle for different alternatives that are possible achieving the objectives. constraints that exist. different alternatives are evaluated based on the objectives and constraints. all the products developed during this cycle are reviewed. Further planning based on user comments is done.  What is Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model?\nRAD model is a type of incremental model. In RAD model the components or functions are developed in parallel as if they were mini projects.\nThe phases in RAD model are:\n Business modeling: The information flow is identified between various business functions. Data modeling: Information gathered from business modeling is used to define data objects that are needed for the business. Process modeling: Descriptions are created for adding, modifying, deleting or retrieving a data object. Application generation: Automated tools are used to convert process models into code and the actual system. Testing and turnover: Test new components and all the interfaces.  What is V - model?\nV-model is also called as verification and validation model.\nIn V model, project development and testing should go parallel. Verification phase should be carried out from SDLC where validation phase should be carried out from STLC.\nAbout different types of testing What is Unit testing?\nThis is first level of testing. It involves checking that each feature specified in the Component Design has been implemented in the component.\nDevelopers do it, as they are the people who understand how a component works.\nWhat is Integration Testing?\nTested components are linked together to check if they work with each other.\nThe tests are organized to check all the interfaces, until all the components have been built and interfaced to each other producing the whole system.\nWhat is System Testing?\nOnce the entire system has been built, it is tested against system specification.\nSystem testing is not about checking the individual parts of the design, but about checking the system as a whole.\nWhat is Acceptance Testing?\n Checks that the system delivers what was requested. Acceptance Testing is a level of the software testing where a system is tested for acceptability.  What is Verification?\n Verification is the process of confirming that software meets its specification. It involves reviews and meetings to evaluate documents, plans, code, requirements and specifications.  What is Validation?\n Validation is the process of confirming that software meets the user’s requirements. Validation typically involves actual testing and takes place after verification are completed.  What is Test Scenario?\n Test Scenario is prepared before the actual testing starts. It includes plans for testing product, number of team members, environmental condition, making test cases, making test plans and all the features that are to be tested for the product.  What is Test Methodology?\nTest methodology is a three step process\n creating a test strategy creating a test plan executing tests  What is Test Strategy?\nTest strategy documents -\n describes the roles, responsibilities and the resources required for the test and schedule. tells us how the software product will be tested. helps to review the test plan with the project team members executing tests.  What is Test Plan?\nTest plan is a document that describes the scope, approach, resources and schedules of internal testing activities.\nWhat is Requirement Test Matrix?\nRequirement Test Matrix is a project management tool for tracking tool for tracking and managing testing efforts based on requirements throughout the project life cycle.\nWhat is Test Case?\nTest case is a documents which contains set of test inputs, execution conditions, and expected output.\nAbout STLC What is STLC?\nSoftware Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is the testing process, in which different activities are carried out to improve the quality of the product.\nSteps in STLC are:\n Requirement Analysis Test planning Test Case Development Environment Setup Test Execution Test Cycle Closure  What is Bug Life Cycle?\nBug life cycle also known as Defect Life Cycle is the journey of a defect cycle, which a defect goes through during its lifetime.\nIt starts when defect is found and ends when a defect is closed, after ensuring it’s not reproduced.\n","wordCount":"847","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-02-20T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-02-20T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Collected from the internet"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://dhar01.github.io/posts/manual-testing-interview-questions/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Loknath's Space","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://dhar01.github.io/favicon.ico"}}}</script>

<p><strong>Software Testing Life Cycle</strong> (<em>STLC</em>) is the testing process, in which different activities are carried out to improve the quality of the product.</p>
<p>Steps in STLC are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Requirement Analysis</li>

<p><strong>Bug life cycle</strong> also known as <em>Defect Life Cycle</em> is the journey of a defect cycle, which a defect goes through during its lifetime.</p>
