      <description>When I wanted to customize my GitHub profile, I visited many developers&amp;rsquo; GitHub profiles and used to see some badges which seems cool to me. When I looked at the code behind the profiles, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the slightest idea what was going on. Later, I tried to copy some of the code and paste them into my code, but it couldn&amp;rsquo;t solve the need.
Well, after some reading and searching, I was able to understand how to make them.</description>
