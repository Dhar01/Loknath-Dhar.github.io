      <description>Everyone should learn how to search.
 (This post contains some google dorking techniques for finding information on the internet. Google is your friend.)
 Searching Narrow down search query, use &amp;quot;_something_&amp;quot;.
Ex: &amp;quot;Liverpool&amp;quot;
For exact topic and site:
site: website-name topic-name site: geekforgeeks sql Some terms    Term Action     filetype: search for a file by its extension   cache: view google&amp;rsquo;s cached version of a specified URL   intitle: the specified phrase MUST appear in the title of the page   allintext: searches specific text contained on any web page   allintitle: show pages that contain titles with X characters   allinurl: used to fetch results whose URL contains all the specified characters   inurl: useful for single keyword, same as allinurl   intitle: used to search for various keywords inside the title   inanchor: useful when need to search for an exact anchor text used on any links.</description>

      <description>The SELECT statement is used to query the database and retrieve data that match the criteria.
The SELECT statement has five main clauses to choose from.
Format of the SELECT statement:
SELECT [ALL | DISTINCT] column1[,column2] FROM [table1, table2] [WHERE &amp;#34;conditions&amp;#34;] [GROUP BY &amp;#34;column-list&amp;#34;] [HAVING &amp;#34;conditions] [ORDER BY &amp;#34;column-list&amp;#34; [ASC | DESC] ] Example:
SELECT name, age, salary FROM employee WHERE age &amp;gt; 40; ALL and DISTINCT are keywords used to select either all (default) or the distinct or unique records in query results.</description>

      <description>This is a note type post for personal reference. I am learning SQL right now and for the learning purpose, I chose two websites:
 SQL Course; SQLBolt;  For awesome learning experience, my advice is to follow one of them according to your preference. This post is just a summary of those content.
Also, if anyone wants to practice SQL, see Hackerrank&amp;rsquo;s SQL problem-set.
 This is still in the early stage.</description>

      <title>Setting up Codeblocks with Freeglut on Linux</title>
      <link>https://dhar01.github.io/posts/codeblocks-with-freeglut-linux/</link>

      <description>In my Computer Graphics class, the teacher asked us to setup Codeblocks for the glut. She gave us a tutorial on how to setup Codeblocks on windows but didn&amp;rsquo;t provide any suggestion to set up on Linux. After some searching on google, I was able to setup Codeblocks with Freeglut (which is an alternative to Glut and available on Linux). This is a kind of writeup (or tutorial) on how I was able to setup Codeblocks with Freeglut.</description>

      <description>Task 2 A DNS request is made. When browser knows the server&amp;rsquo;s IP address, it ask the server for the web page which is done with a HTTP GET request.
GET is an example of a HTTP verb, which are the different types of request. The server responds to the GET request with the web page content. IF the web page is loading extra resources, like JavaScript, images, or CSS files, those will be retrieved in separate GET requests.</description>

      <description>Shodan.io is a search engine for the internet of things. There is a room about Shodan in Tryhackme and this walk-through is about that.
 Due to the nature of Shodan and its scanning services, the answer is changing all the time. So keep trying.
 Task 01 An autonomous system number (ASN) is a global identifier of a range of IP addresses. Basically, large companies like Google, Microsoft have their own ASN for all of the IP addresses they own.</description>
