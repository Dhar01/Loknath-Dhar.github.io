      <description>I often consider myself &amp;ldquo;Lucky&amp;rdquo; to be born in this era; the era of being connected, knowledge sharing and collaboration. While scrolling through the internet, I found so many well-written thoughts and blogs that should be shared. In my daily life, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to be a DevOps practitioner, to be a gopher and sharpen my knowledge of the basics.
Here, I will share some resources, i.e., blogs I find amazing. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a DevOps practitioner, SRE, Linux System Administrator or belief in self-development - these resources will significantly help you.</description>

      <description>As I am highly dependent on official documentation, I found that Apache Solr maintain an awesome documentation from which I learned a lot. Setting up SSL can be found here. I am writing this for easier step by step setup.
Happy Searching!
Generate certificate &amp;amp; key From the official documentation, you can generate a self-signed certificate to test your setup. But for the trusted authority, generate a certificate and convert it to .</description>

      <title>Setting Up SolrCloud for Production</title>

      <description>I wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with SolrCloud when I started working with this. When I started to learn it and working directly with it - I had done so many mistakes. Even setting up SolrCloud for production was a hassle for me (I&amp;rsquo;m a slow learner). But overtime, I got a hang of it and I think writing an up-to-date guide to set up SolrCloud on production server is a good idea.</description>

      <description>SCM : Source Control Management.
VCS: Version Control System.
All of the content here is for command line, as I am very comfortable with terminal [and of course Linux].
Basic git syntax: program | action | destination.
For example: git | add | .
Configure git # set your name $ git config user.name &amp;#34;user-name&amp;#34; # set your email $ git config user.email &amp;#34;user-email@example.com&amp;#34; # set global user name $ git config --global user.</description>

      <description>When I wanted to customize my GitHub profile, I visited many developers&amp;rsquo; GitHub profiles. I saw some badges which seemed cool to me. When I looked at the code behind the shapes, I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what was happening. Later, I tried to copy some of the code and paste them into my code, but it couldn&amp;rsquo;t solve the need.
After some reading and searching, I understood how to make them. I am writing this post as a reference so that one can understand how to make those badges, including me.</description>

      <description>The SELECT statement is used to query the database and retrieve data that match the criteria.
The SELECT statement has five main clauses to choose from.
Format of the SELECT statement:
SELECT [ALL | DISTINCT] column1[,column2] FROM [table1, table2] [WHERE &amp;#34;conditions&amp;#34;] [GROUP BY &amp;#34;column-list&amp;#34;] [HAVING &amp;#34;conditions] [ORDER BY &amp;#34;column-list&amp;#34; [ASC | DESC] ] Example:
SELECT name, age, salary FROM employee WHERE age &amp;gt; 40; ALL and DISTINCT are keywords used to select either all (default) or the distinct or unique records in query results.</description>

      <description>This is a note type post for personal reference. I am learning SQL right now and for the learning purpose, I chose two websites:
SQL Course; SQLBolt; For awesome learning experience, my advice is to follow one of them according to your preference. This post is just a summary of those content.
Also, if anyone wants to practice SQL, see Hackerrank&amp;rsquo;s SQL problem-set.
This is still in the early stage. Any suggestions will be appreciated.</description>

      <description>👋 Hey there I’m Loknath, a Linux enthusiast who bleeds Liverpool RED on matchday! Trying to be a programmer with Golang, also an infrequent writer. I enjoy cinema, and anime, can’t live without songs, and buy more books than I read. I feel like dancing on the occasion of playing Fifa, sometimes craving for the smell and sounds of rain, and most of the time, haha, for off days.
In the daytime, I would love to see myself as a storyteller, but in reality, I pass my days as Jr.</description>

      <description>In my Computer Graphics class, the teacher asked us to setup Codeblocks for the glut. She gave us a tutorial on how to setup Codeblocks on windows but didn&amp;rsquo;t provide any suggestion to set up on Linux. After some searching on google, I was able to setup Codeblocks with Freeglut (which is an alternative to Glut and available on Linux). This is a kind of writeup (or tutorial) on how I was able to setup Codeblocks with Freeglut.</description>

      <description>Task 2 A DNS request is made. When browser knows the server&amp;rsquo;s IP address, it ask the server for the web page which is done with a HTTP GET request.
GET is an example of a HTTP verb, which are the different types of request. The server responds to the GET request with the web page content. IF the web page is loading extra resources, like JavaScript, images, or CSS files, those will be retrieved in separate GET requests.</description>

      <description>Shodan.io is a search engine for the internet of things. There is a room about Shodan in Tryhackme and this walk-through is about that.
Due to the nature of Shodan and its scanning services, the answer is changing all the time. So keep trying.
